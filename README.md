# Front-end-Project-s
This is a repository of the combination of learning which I have done from various sources including codecadamey and other sources so I can demonstrate my ability.
Below is a list of all projects i have done which are in this resository


## Cat App 
- This was the first project I have made via HTML 

## New York Blog 

- This task was the second project where I learned the basics of HTML and the use of a sperate sytle sheet. 


## Vacation spots 
- This task was the third one which on I had to build a webpage and then change fonts and styles according to the tasks ( hence why this one is a mish mash site).
